# Plans


- The Exam
    - Start early in the morning because my brain is at its peak the first few hours (I could think clearly). 
    -  First clear the passing marks by doing 4 boxes.
    - Then move on to Buffer Overflow.


- What the Exam Machines are like
    - 1x10 pointer: this is easy boot to root machine. There will be a lot of ports open similar to Metasploitable but look for the unique service in a unique port. 
    
    - 2x20 pointer: These will be similar to HTB machines such as October, Popcorn, Shocker, Beep.

    - 2x25 pointer: One is Buffer Overflow and the other is a slightly harder, rabbit holed filled machine. Maybe Giddy, Jeeves.
